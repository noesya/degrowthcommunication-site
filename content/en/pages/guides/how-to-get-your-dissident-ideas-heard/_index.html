        <p>To build a devoted audience, prioritize creating engaging content daily. This routine helps integrate your work into people's daily lives, fostering a consistent connection. Quality and regularity encourage sharing, which in turn increases your audience size. Daily creation also drives continuous innovation and learning, pushing you to explore new ideas and perspectives. While perfection isn't mandatory—missing a day occasionally is fine—the goal is to produce content as regularly as possible.<br></p>

        <p>Focus on engaging directly with your audience, bypassing traditional publishing avenues. Tailor your content to resonate with readers, not to fit the preferences of conventional media outlets, which are becoming less relevant in today’s digital landscape. Your real audience is those who share and interact with your content online, not the traditional gatekeepers. Embrace the freedom to express your ideas without censorship, aiming to connect authentically with those who value your voice.<br></p>
