        <p><b>Form a team: </b>Working with one or two other people can make the planning process easier, allowing you to divide tasks such as facilitation, content, logistics, and snacks. If you prefer to organize solo, consider enlisting volunteers for specific roles during the workshop to ensure it runs smoothly.</p><p><b>Logistics</b><b>:</b> Identify a suitable location, date, and time (2 hours is best!) for your workshop well in advance. Ensure the venue is accessible to all participants.</p><p><b>Advertise</b><b>!</b> Word of mouth, email lists, social media, posters, and announcements at related gatherings can go a long way. </p><p><b>Here is a workshop description you can use or modify:</b></p><p>Confront the challenges of rising global emissions, biodiversity loss, and increasing societal disconnection with us. The degrowth movement offers a hopeful vision for the future, critiquing the relentless pursuit of economic growth and proposing a society focused on ecological balance, justice and collective well-being. Join our interactive workshop to explore what degrowth entails, its potential benefits for you and your community, and how we can collectively strive towards the transformative change our world needs.</p><p><b>Utilise available resources:</b> Use our ready-made presentation slides if your workshop location includes a projector. They are designed to be flexible, and we strongly encourage you to modify them to suit your local context better. Doing so can make the presentation much more relatable, actionable and engaging.
