      1. Increase Public Distrust of the Mainstream Media

        <p>Raising public scepticism towards mainstream media is crucial for shifting power to the people from the oligarchs. Influential media personalities have significant power in shaping public opinion and policy, sometimes <a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20090209/question-morning-joe-or-sen-joe" target="_blank">more than elected officials</a>. By continuously exposing and questioning the media's intentions and actions, we can foster a healthy suspicion among the public. This awareness is vital as it undermines the trust in narratives these media outlets push, effectively challenging their influence.<br></p>

      2. Shatter the Illusion of Normalcy

        <p>Breaking the "normalcy" spell cast by government and media psychological operations is key. The U. S. <a href="https://www.occupycorporatism.com/how-the-ndaa-allows-us-gov-to-use-propaganda-against-americans/" target="_blank">legally</a> uses these operations to <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/03/25/how-us-flooded-the-world-with-psyops/" target="_blank">shape public views</a>, normalizing actions and conditions that should raise concern, such as economic disparity, military aggression, and surveillance. This effort, supported by a media owned by few corporations with historical ties to intelligence agencies, aims to make such issues seem ordinary. The mission is to wake the public up to this manipulation, challenging the acceptance of these so-called norms and encouraging a call for change by questioning the status quo.<br></p>

      3. Shatter the illusion of unanimity

        <p>Breaking the illusion of consensus is vital. Often, the media, owned by a few, projects a unified stance on major issues, creating a false sense of agreement among the public. This strategy makes unverified claims seem like undeniable facts, marginalizing dissenting voices. The key to combat this is by confidently challenging these narratives and spreading alternative viewpoints as widely as possible<br></p>

        <p>Remember and resist the media's short memory cycle. The constant, fast-paced news often makes us forget past misdeeds, like election manipulations, propaganda efforts, and untruths about wars. It's crucial to continuously recall and discuss these issues, preventing them from being swept away by the next news wave.Â By refusing to forget or forgive these actions, we challenge the establishment's desire for us to move on without addressing past wrongs and demand accountability.<br></p>
