        <p>Raising public scepticism towards mainstream media is crucial for shifting power to the people from the oligarchs. Influential media personalities have significant power in shaping public opinion and policy, sometimes <a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20090209/question-morning-joe-or-sen-joe" target="_blank">more than elected officials</a>. By continuously exposing and questioning the media's intentions and actions, we can foster a healthy suspicion among the public. This awareness is vital as it undermines the trust in narratives these media outlets push, effectively challenging their influence.<br></p>
