        <p><b>Here is a list of studies, surveys and polling results that shed some light on popular perceptions of post-growth and post-capitalist ideas.</b></p><p><b>1.</b> A survey of people in 34 European countries found that on average 61 % are in favour of post-growth. The study also finds that support for post-growth is lower among disadvantaged communities, indicating the need to highlight the key role of redistributive policies that can improve livelihoods and economic security for the working-classes.

Source: <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/publikationen/umweltbewusstsein-in-deutschland-2022"><i>Umwelt Bundesamt</i></a>, 2023.</p><p><b>3.</b> Poll shows that 81 % of people in Britain believe that the prime objective of the governments should be to secure “the greatest happiness” for people rather than “the greatest wealth”.

        <p><b>1.</b> Post-growth and degrowth frameworks call for sufficiency-oriented policies. A study of European citizens’ assemblies found that sufficiency policies enjoy very high approval rates (93 %). The study also found that sufficiency objectives achieved through regulatory policies had the highest support.

In the UK, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-poll-universal-basic-income-rent-control-job-safety-a9486806.html">72 % of people</a> support it. In the U.
