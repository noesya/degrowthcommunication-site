summary: >
  Below is a list of research, surveys, and poll results showing people's thoughts about post-growth and post-capitalist ideas. This collection helps debunk the myth that seeking an economy more in harmony with our environment is hugely unpopular and, therefore, unrealistic. In fact, the data suggests that a significant number of people are open to, and even support, the idea of prioritizing ecological well-being over relentless economic growth. <br><br>Explore or reference the insights below to strengthen your arguments or show others the potential support for degrowth.

        <p><b>1.</b> A survey of people in 34 European countries found that, on average, 61 % favour post-growth. The study also finds that support for post-growth is lower among disadvantaged communities, indicating the need to highlight the key role of redistributive policies that can improve livelihoods and economic security for the working classes.

        <p><b>1.</b> Post-growth and degrowth frameworks call for sufficiency-oriented policies. A study of European citizens’ assemblies found that sufficiency policies enjoy very high approval rates (93 %). The study also found that sufficiency objectives achieved through regulatory policies had the highest support. Source: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629623003146" target="_blank"><i>Energy Research and Social Science</i></a><i>,</i> 2023.</p><p><b>2.</b> The job guarantee is a central post-growth/degrowth policy, and it is highly popular in polls. In the UK, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-poll-universal-basic-income-rent-control-job-safety-a9486806.html" target="_blank">72 % of people</a> support it. In the US, <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/468236-majority-of-voters-support-a-federal-jobs-guarantee-program/" target="_blank">it’s 78 %</a>, and in France, it’s <a href="https://feps-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/A-Job-Guarantee-For-Europe.pdf" target="_blank">79 %</a>. Few policies enjoy such widespread support, and research shows they can <a href="https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/08125102/TrumpsKryptonite_Final_June2023.pdf" target="_blank">appeal strongly</a> to working-class voters who otherwise feel alienated from the political process.</p><p><b>3.</b> Universal Basic Income (UBI) is another core post-growth policy proposal and has support across much of Europe. Nearly half of all British adults (48 %) would support the introduction of UBI. In Germany, it's 55 %, in Spain, 53 % and in Italy, 52 % of adults would support it.

Note that Yale has not used this question in more recent climate opinion surveys.</p><p><b>2.</b> Poll shows that substantial majorities of people in 10 of 12 European countries believe that protecting the environment should be made a priority even if it comes at the expense of economic growth. Source: <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/01/europe-south-and-east-worry-more-about-emigration-than-immigration-poll">European Council on Foreign Relations</a></em>, 2019.</p><p><b>3.</b> Gallup poll data shows a majority of respondents believe that environmental protection should be given priority, even at the risk of curbing growth. Source: <em><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1615/environment.aspx">Gallup</a></em>, 2023.</p><p><b>4.</b> A review of representative surveys in Europe and the U.

It is reasonable to expect that, if respondents were informed that post-growth policy can <i>improve</i> social outcomes, support for these statements may be even stronger.</p>
