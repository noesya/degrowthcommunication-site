        <p><b>Here is a list of studies, surveys and polling results that shed some light on popular perceptions of post-growth and post-capitalist ideas.</b></p><p><b>1.</b> A survey of people in 34 European countries found that on average 61 % are in favour of post-growth. The study also finds that support for post-growth is lower among disadvantaged communities, indicating the need to highlight the key role of redistributive policies that can improve livelihoods and economic security for the working-classes.

Source: <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/publikationen/umweltbewusstsein-in-deutschland-2022"><i>Umwelt Bundesamt</i></a>, 2023.</p><p><b>3.</b> Poll shows that 81 % of people in Britain believe that the prime objective of the governments should be to secure “the greatest happiness” for people rather than “the greatest wealth”. Source: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/happiness_formula/4771908.stm"><em>BBC</em></a>, 2006.</p><p><b>4.</b> A consumer research study found that 70 % of more than 10,000 people surveyed in 29 high-income and middle-income countries believe that “overconsumption is putting our planet and society at risk”. 65 % believe that “our society would be better off if people shared more and owned less.” Source: <em><a href="https://sustainablebrands.com/read/defining-the-next-economy/havas-smarter-consumers-will-significantly-alter-economic-models-and-the-role-of-brands">Sustainable Brands</a></em>, 2014.</p>
