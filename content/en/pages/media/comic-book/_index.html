        <p>Degrowth is not only possible and necessary; it entails all kinds of good stuff you probably haven’t heard about. It is also, despite all claims to the contrary, something that cannot be done to people but can only be truly achieved by a mass movement of the people.</p><p>‘Who Is Afraid of Degrowth’ offers a new way to learn about degrowth and join the most important debate of our time.</p>
