        <p>Check out this thought-provoking article on Degrowth written in the style of the iconic magazine <a href="https://www.adbusters.org/full-articles/honey-i-shrunk-my-life-taking-degrowth-seriously" target="_blank">Adbusters</a>. The piece, written by three students of the Autonomous University of Barcelona as an assignment for the <a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/postgraduate/master-in-degrowth-ecology-economics-and-policy/general-information-1217916968009.html/param1-4561_en/" target="_blank">Masters on Degrowth: Ecology, Economics and Policy</a>, delves into the problems of our growth-obsessed society and explores the possibilities of a new way forward. <br><br>While we may not own the photos, we hope they inspire you to question the status quo and imagine a better world. Download the file, print it, and leave it on bus stops, workplaces, benches, and the like. Time is ticking, and we need global consciousness for the shifts we envision.<br></p>
