        <p>Check out this thought-provoking article on Degrowth written in the style of the iconic magazine <a href="https://www.adbusters.org/full-articles/honey-i-shrunk-my-life-taking-degrowth-seriously" target="_blank">Adbusters</a>. The piece, written by three students of the Autonomous University of Barcelona as an assignment for the <a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/postgraduate/master-in-degrowth-ecology-economics-and-policy/general-information-1217916968009.html/param1-4561_en/" target="_blank">Masters on Degrowth: Ecology, Economics and Policy</a>, delves into the problems of our growth-obsessed society and explores the possibilities of a new way forward. And while we may not own the photos, we hope they inspire you to question the status quo and imagine a better world.<br></p>
