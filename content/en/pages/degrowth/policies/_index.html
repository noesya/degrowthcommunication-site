summary: >
  Here, we explore actionable policies and strategies that challenge the conventional pursuit of economic growth, focusing instead on enhancing well-being for all within our planet's ecological limits. From guaranteeing universally basic services and redistributing wealth to prioritising local economies and increasing workplace democracy, these policies are about making bold choices for the health of our planet and the betterment of our communities. Join us in envisioning and advocating for a degrowth future where progress is measured not by the quantity of goods produced but by the quality of life shared by everyone.

        <p>Degrowth policies cover many aspects of society and our economy. There are hundreds of proposed policies, that could all work together to bring about a degrowth transition. To navigate this diversity, we're following the excellent example set out by a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622023629" target="_blank">paper that mapped 530 policies</a> and structured our content around 13 thematic areas, each reflecting a critical aspect of degrowth. </p><p>Further, to provide clarity and direction, we've categorised policies into two key dimensions:</p><p><b>Policy Ends (Goals, Objectives, Targets): </b>This dimension focuses on the 'what'—the outcomes we aim to achieve through degrowth. These goals guide our vision and outline the desired end states that reflect our values and priorities in the degrowth movement.</p><p><b>Policy Means (Methods, Instruments, Calibration): </b>Here, we address the 'how'—the tools, methods, and processes we employ to achieve our degrowth objectives. This includes a range of policy instruments and interventions designed to address specific challenges and opportunities within each thematic area.<br><br>This will allow for a more meaningful understanding of both the objectives of degrowth and the practical steps required to realise them. <br></p>

        <p>A comprehensive review of degrowth literature revealed 530 specific policy proposals across 13 themes, such as energy, finance, and urban planning, offering an exhaustive degrowth policy toolbox. This study makes a rich array of degrowth strategies accessible, outlining clear goals, objectives, and instruments essential for guiding sustainable policy-making.<br></p>

        <p><i><b>Reduce Environmental Pressures<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Implement strategies to significantly lower the ecological impact on our planet by reducing resource use, emissions, and pollution.</p><p><b>Diminishing Caps on Resource Use, Emissions, and Pollution:</b> Introduce policies that set progressively lower limits on the amount of natural resources consumed, greenhouse gases emitted, and pollutants released. These policies should prioritise resource-intensive industries such as petrochemicals, steel, iron, cement and automotive. This could require a global democratic cap and share programme or a mandated reduction of 40-50 % of the biophysical footprint in overshooting nations. </p><p><b>Ecological Tax Reform:</b> Reform tax systems to incentivise sustainable practices and penalise environmental degradation. Taxes on carbon emissions, resource extraction, natural capital depletion, and pollution can discourage harmful activities. Divesting from unethical industries such as fossil fuels, mining, and arms simultaneously is also key.</p><p><b>Moratoria on Resource Extraction and Big Infrastructure: </b>Enact temporary halts on new resource extraction projects (like mining and deforestation) and large-scale infrastructure developments (such as dams and highways) that threaten ecosystems and biodiversity. <br><br><br></p><p><b><i>Halt Fossil Fuel Use<br></i></b><i>Objective</i>: Cease society's reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p><b>Abolish Fossil Fuel Subsidies</b>: Eliminate financial support and subsidies for fossil fuel industries equitably and justly.</p><p><b>Phase-Out of Existing Fossil Fuels</b>: Implement strategies for the gradual discontinuation of fossil fuel extraction and use (80-100 % reduction by 2050), beginning with hyper-polluting power plants and ensuring a just transition for workers and communities dependent on these industries as well as universal basic electricity to households.</p><p><b>Nationalise to Phase-Out Fossil Companies</b>: Take fossil fuel companies into public ownership to manage the phase-out process, prioritising environmental protection and workers' rights over profits.<br><br><br><i><b>Promote Energy Democracy<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Ensure community control and equitable access to energy, fostering sustainable and renewable energy systems owned and managed by local communities.</p><p><b>Convivial Community-Owned Renewable Systems</b>: Support the development of renewable energy projects owned and operated by local communities, enhancing energy access and sovereignty.</p><p><b>Build Off-Grid Systems</b>: Encourage establishing off-grid renewable energy systems, particularly in remote or underserved areas, to provide sustainable and independent energy solutions.</p><p><b>Oppose Large-Scale Renewable Systems</b>: Advocate for energy solutions that are scalable and adaptable to local needs, avoiding the ecological and social issues associated with large-scale renewable energy projects.<br><i><b><br><br>Reduce Energy Demand and Use<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Implement strategies to significantly lower energy consumption and waste, promoting efficiency and sufficiency in energy use.</p><p><b>Energy Efficiency Improvements</b>: Implement policies that enhance energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry, reducing overall energy demand.</p><p><b>Promote Energy Sufficiency</b>: Encourage practices and lifestyles that align with energy sufficiency, such as reducing unnecessary consumption, optimising energy use in homes and businesses, and supporting local, low-energy solutions.<br><b><br><br></b><b><i>Restore and Preserve Biodiversity<br></i></b><i><b>Objective</b></i>: Implement measures to protect, restore, and enhance the diversity of life on Earth, from genes and species to ecosystems.</p><p><b>Legislate the Rights of Nature</b>: Recognise ecosystems and natural entities as legal subjects with rights, enabling legal actions to protect biodiversity. Strengthen regulations to stop the commercialisation of nature and establish a coherent network of marine protected areas.</p><p><b>Create Resource Sanctuaries</b>: Designate protected areas as sanctuaries for biodiversity, prohibiting activities that could harm wildlife or degrade natural habitats. Advocate for the preservation of knowledge, languages and techniques that protect life.<br><br><br><b><i>Promote Stable Demography<br></i></b><i><b>Objective</b></i>: Encourage democratic demographic stability by achieving sustainable population levels.</p><p><b>Bottom-up Empowerment of Women</b>: Support policies and programmes that empower women to make informed decisions about reproduction, including access to contraception and reproductive health services.</p><p><b>Educational and Vocational Opportunities for Women and Girls</b>: Increase access to education and vocational training for women and girls, recognising the strong link between education and reduced fertility rates.</p>
