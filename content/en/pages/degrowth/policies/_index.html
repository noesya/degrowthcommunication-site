summary: >
  Here, we explore actionable policies and strategies that challenge the conventional pursuit of economic growth, focusing instead on enhancing well-being for all within our planet's ecological limits. From guaranteeing universally basic services and redistributing wealth to prioritizing local economies and increasing workplace democracy, these policies are about making bold choices for the health of our planet and the betterment of our communities. Join us in envisioning and advocating for a degrowth future where progress is measured not by the quantity of goods produced but by the quality of life shared by everyone.
