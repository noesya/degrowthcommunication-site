summary: >
  Here, we explore actionable policies and strategies that challenge the conventional pursuit of economic growth, focusing instead on enhancing well-being for all within our planet's ecological limits. From guaranteeing universally basic services and redistributing wealth to prioritizing local economies and increasing workplace democracy, these policies are about making bold choices for the health of our planet and the betterment of our communities. Join us in envisioning and advocating for a degrowth future where progress is measured not by the quantity of goods produced but by the quality of life shared by everyone.

        <p>Degrowth policies cover many aspects of society and our economy. There are hundreds of proposed policies, that could all work together to bring about a degrowth transition. To navigate this diversity, we're following the excellent example set out by a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622023629" target="_blank">paper that mapped 530 policies</a> and structured our content around 13 thematic areas, each reflecting a critical aspect of degrowth. </p><p>Further, to provide clarity and direction, we've categorized policies into two key dimensions:</p><p><b>Policy Ends (Goals, Objectives, Targets): </b>This dimension focuses on the 'what'—the outcomes we aim to achieve through degrowth. These goals guide our vision and outline the desired end states that reflect our values and priorities in the degrowth movement.</p><p><b>Policy Means (Methods, Instruments, Calibration): </b>Here, we address the 'how'—the tools, methods, and processes we employ to achieve our degrowth objectives. This includes a range of policy instruments and interventions designed to address specific challenges and opportunities within each thematic area.<br><br>This will allow for a more meaningful understanding of both the objectives of degrowth and the practical steps required to realize them. <br></p>
