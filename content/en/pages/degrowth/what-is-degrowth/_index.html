summary: >
  This page presents a definition of degrowth that goes beyond the mainstream narrative, weaving together the rich tapestry of ideas, struggles, and movements that have shaped its evolution. Here, we invite you to delve into a vision of degrowth that is as diverse and inclusive as humanity itself, one that recognizes the contributions of all voices in the conversation—from grassroots activists to academic scholars.<br><br>Let us consider how degrowth can inform our personal choices, our community actions, and our societal goals. This is more than an academic exercise; it's a call to action for a sustainable, equitable, and fulfilling future.

        <p>Degrowth is a transformative movement and critical framework that challenges the prevailing growth-centric economic and social paradigms. It advocates for a conscious and democratic reduction in production and consumption to align human activities with ecological limits while ensuring social justice and enhancing well-being for all. Degrowth is not a one-size-fits-all concept but a mosaic of ideas, practices, and visions that draw from a variety of sources.</p><p>Rooted in the recognition that sustainable practices and equitable living arrangements have long been part of many cultures and societies around the world, degrowth embraces wisdom from grassroots movements, indigenous traditions, feminist theories, anti-racist actions, queer empowerment, decolonial struggles, and other critical perspectives that have historically been marginalized in mainstream discourse. It seeks to democratize the discourse around equitable, sustainable living, highlighting the importance of local actions, communal living, care work, and solidarity economies.</p><p>Degrowth envisions a world where communities are organized around values of care, commons, sharing, simplicity, and conviviality. It acknowledges the vital contributions of academic, non-academic, multi-identitied individuals and groups and integrates their lived experiences and insights into a broader, inclusive narrative. By doing so, degrowth moves beyond abstract critiques of capitalism to foster tangible practices and strategies for societal transformation.</p><p>In promoting degrowth, thinkers, actors, artists, activists, practitioners, and many others encourage a shift from hierarchical and exclusionary representations to a more open and diverse dialogue. This entails moving away from defining degrowth through a singular lens and, instead, recognizing a spectrum of degrowth literature, thinkers, and actors contributing to a shared vision for a just and sustainable future. Through this inclusive approach, degrowth aims to weave together a tapestry of solidarity across divisions, diversities, and hierarchies, championing a future where ecological sustainability and human flourishing are intertwined.</p>
