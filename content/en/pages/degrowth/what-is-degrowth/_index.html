summary: >
  This page presents a definition of degrowth that goes beyond the mainstream narrative, weaving together the rich tapestry of ideas, struggles, and movements that have shaped its evolution. Here, we invite you to delve into a vision of degrowth that is as diverse and inclusive as humanity itself, one that recognizes the contributions of all voices in the conversation—from grassroots activists to academic scholars.<br><br>Let us consider how degrowth can inform our personal choices, our community actions, and our societal goals. This is more than an academic exercise; it's a call to action for a sustainable, equitable, and fulfilling future.
