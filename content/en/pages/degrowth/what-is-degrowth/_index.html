summary: >
  This page presents a definition of degrowth that goes beyond the mainstream narrative, weaving together the rich tapestry of ideas, struggles, and movements that have shaped its evolution. Here, we invite you to delve into a vision of degrowth that is as diverse and inclusive as humanity itself, one that recognises the contributions of all voices in the conversation—from grassroots activists to academic scholars.<br><br>Let us consider how degrowth can inform our personal choices, our community actions, and our societal goals. This is more than an academic exercise; it's a call to action.

        <p>Degrowth is a transformative movement and critical framework that challenges the prevailing growth-centric economic and social paradigms. It advocates for a conscious and democratic reduction in material and energy used in production and consumption to <b>align human activities with ecological limits while ensuring social justice and enhancing well-being for all</b>. Degrowth is not a one-size-fits-all concept but a mosaic of ideas, practices, and visions that draw from a variety of sources.</p><p>Rooted in the recognition that sustainable practices and <b>equitable living arrangements have long been part of many cultures and societies around the world</b>, degrowth embraces wisdom from grassroots movements, indigenous traditions, feminist theories, anti-racist actions, queer empowerment, decolonial struggles, and other critical perspectives that have historically been marginalized in mainstream discourse. It seeks to democratize the discourse around equitable, sustainable living, highlighting the importance of local actions, communal living, care work, and solidarity economies.</p><p>Degrowth envisions a world where communities are organized around <b>values of care, commons, sharing, simplicity, and conviviality</b>. It acknowledges the vital contributions of academic, non-academic, multi-identitied individuals and groups and integrates their lived experiences and insights into a broader, inclusive narrative. By doing so, degrowth moves <b>beyond abstract critiques of capitalism to foster tangible practices and strategies for societal transformation.</b></p><p>In promoting degrowth, thinkers, actors, artists, activists, practitioners, and many others encourage a shift from hierarchical and exclusionary representations to a more open and diverse dialogue. This entails moving away from defining degrowth through a singular lens and, instead, recognizing a spectrum of degrowth literature, thinkers, and actors contributing to a shared vision for a just and sustainable future. Through this inclusive approach, degrowth aims to weave together a tapestry of <b>solidarity </b>across divisions, diversities, and hierarchies, <b>championing a future where ecological sustainability and human flourishing are intertwined.</b></p>

        <p><a href="https://t.co/ojhwvULjWk" target="_blank"><b>Centring the Global South in the Discourse</b></a><b> - By Barbara Magalhães Teixeira and Başak Koşanay<br></b><br>This reading is crucial since many of the ideas in degrowth discourses come from movements and cosmovisions of the Global South. <br><br>This discussion stresses the urgency for Global South actors to take the lead in embracing degrowth. Global South societies cannot wait for those in the North to act first, especially given it has historically caused much of the ecological and social harm we face today. Continuing to focus on the Global North not only keeps old inequalities and hierarchies in place but also overlooks the visions and practices advanced in Global South context's potential for initiating real change. Northern ideas, having been the oppressor, might not be the best to lead the charge for freedom from these global issues.<br><br>Southern ideas, actors and initiatives are envisioned as a powerful source of resistance and the true catalyst for a degrowth transition that the whole world needs. This shift involves breaking away from the global capitalist economy and leading by example, prompting necessary changes from Northern systems and actors as well. </p><p><b><a href="https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/32057/2/POL_thesis_%20RichterK_2022.pdf" target="_blank">Bridging Degrowth and Buen Vivir</a> - By </b><b>Katharina Richter<br></b><b><br></b>This thesis explores the dialogue between the degrowth movement and Buen Vivir/sumak kawsay, a paradigm from Latin America advocating for life in harmony beyond development. It contributes to the important conversations on decolonizing degrowth by highlighting how degrowth's often mechanistic and eurocentric focus on socioeconomic aspects leaves cultural dimensions less explored.<br><br>Responding to this, the thesis introduces cultural and political alternatives that challenge degrowth's human-centred focus. It proposes a decolonial framework that centres on relational justice, the reintegration of nature into our social fabric and cosmological limits to growth.</p><p><b><a href="https://www.degrowthjournal.org/publications/2023-05-03-why-are-feminist-perspectives-analyses-and-actions-vital-to-degrowth/" target="_blank">Feminism's Key Role in Degrowth</a>- By the </b><b>Feminisms and Degrowth Alliance<br></b><b><br></b>Feminist theories and methods that acknowledge and support diverse voices, knowledges, and practices are vital resources for building on heterodox degrowth movements. In dialogue with postcolonial, decolonial, indigenous, and anti-racist efforts, intersectional feminisms have been unlearning and disrupting conventional politics of knowing and action in ways that help forge more inclusive understandings and applications necessary for degrowth futures. Feminist thinking helps us imagine a world where everyone's well-being matters, not just economic growth.</p>

It is merely meant to show that degrowth is much much more than what we usually hear in the eurocentric academic discourse. Please do reach out if you would like to edit / add to it. </p>
