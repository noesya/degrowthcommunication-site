        <p>In wealthier countries, the excessive use of energy and materials contributes significantly to climate change and environmental degradation, while surprisingly, these nations often struggle to meet the basic needs of their populations, such as housing, healthcare, and nutrition. Addressing this dual issue requires a transformative shift in our economic approach</p><p>To begin, it's necessary for rich countries to scale back on non-essential production and consumption to lessen ecological impacts and decarbonize more rapidly. This means reducing reliance on energy and material-intensive luxuries like SUVs, private jets, and oversized homes, as well as unsustainable practices such as the industrial production of meat and the culture of fast fashion. It involves curbing the wealth excesses of the very rich, promoting public transportation over private vehicle use, and fostering a culture of durability and reparability in consumer goods.</p><p>Simultaneously, the focus must shift toward enhancing social progress and human well-being. This encompasses guaranteeing universal access to high-quality essential public services like healthcare, education, childcare and transportation, alongside ensuring affordable housing and living wages for all. Implementing a public job guarantee (a programme where the municipal government provides jobs to those willing and able to work and is funded nationally) could serve as a cornerstone, providing employment in sectors crucial for ecological restoration and social welfare (think insulating homes, building out renewable energy, regenerating ecosystems). This would end unemployment and economic insecurity and contribute to the improvement of human well-being, plus give us a shot at achieving the 1.5 °C Paris Agreement.</p><p>This would also require achieving economic democracy, contrasting sharply with the current system where economic decisions (what is produced, how, and for whom) largely benefit a wealthy minority. Democratising the economy involves workplace democracy, giving employees a voice in the governance of their workplaces, likely steering priorities towards well-being and ecological health rather than profit maximization.</p><p>Crucially, this transformation has implications beyond high-income nations. The current global system enables high-income countries to over-exploit resources, often coming from and at the expense of the Global South, exacerbating environmental and social issues in these regions. This exploitative relationship must end and shift to a more equitable international economy that allows all people to live decently within the Earth's ecological bounds.</p><p>Lastly, embracing these changes does not equate to rejecting technology. Instead, it means a balanced approach where technological innovation and efficiency improvements are pursued as long as they are sustainable, safe, and equitable. The focus is on achieving efficiency in resource use and promoting sufficiency by scaling down non-essential production and ensuring a fair distribution of resources.</p>
