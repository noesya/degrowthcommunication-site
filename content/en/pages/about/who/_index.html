        <p>Hi there, I'm JP, a descendant of European settlers in México, now making my home in Paris. I've dedicated myself to the pursuit of a world where people collectively plan the fair distribution of resources to provide well-being for all within ecological limits. My journey has led me to the heart of the degrowth movement, a space where I have felt welcomed and loved. I believe there is a lot of work ahead of us, and I just hope this project can help push us a little bit closer to our goals. </p><p>Creating, designing, and curating the content for this website has been a labour of love, guided by the belief that empathy, humility and accessible knowledge are crucial for our fight. This project is a testament to the collaborative spirit of dozens of individuals and organizations who share a vision for a sustainable and equitable future. Their invaluable, beautiful and selfless contributions are recognized and celebrated below.</p>
