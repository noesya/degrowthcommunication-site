        <p><b>Autonomy &amp; Democracy</b>: <br>Autonomy and democracy are about freeing ourselves from the necessity of working to survive and having the space to make choices that truly enrich our lives. It's about coming together to make decisions democratically, ensuring that our communities live and work in ways that feel right to us. <br><b>Care</b>: <br>Care is about showing compassion and support for each other, our communities, and all life on Earth. It's about valuing kindness and solidarity over competition and greed.<br><b>Justice</b>:<br>Justice means ensuring everyone has a fair chance at a good life, no matter where they come from or what they look like. It's about acknowledging and correcting historical wrongs, reducing excess consumption in wealthier nations and among those living beyond their fair share, aiming for social justice and equality both today and for future generations. It's about making sure that downscaling happens where it's needed most to achieve a balanced and fair distribution of the benefits and impacts of our economy.<br><br><b>Sustainability &amp; Sufficiency</b>: <br>Sustainability and sufficiency ensure everyone has what they need to live well within the ecological limits that allow the planet to support and regenerate all forms of life, now and in the future. It's about making choices that protect the reproduction of life so it continues to thrive with us all.<br><b>Well-being</b>:<br>Well-being is all about living a good, decent and dignified life, where everyone's and everything's health and happiness matter more than how much stuff we own. It's about creating a world where we all feel safe, happy, fulfilled and connected to our communities.<br><b>Sovereignty</b>: <br>Sovereignty is the power of communities to make their own choices about their land, food, water, energy, currency, technology and resources. It's about being in control of what matters to us, ensuring our needs are met without harming the planet. This is particularly emphasised for colonised, oppressed, marginalised and occupied communities) <br><b>Community</b>: Community is about building strong, supportive and resilient networks where we look after each other. It's celebrating togetherness and collaboration, creating a sense of belonging, mutual care and interdependence with each other and our surrounding ecosystems.</p>

        <p>(1) Resource sovereignty: Be a steward of nature. Those making decisions about resource extraction should be the communities who are most directly impacted by these decisions, who are knowledgeable about ecosystems, and who assume the responsibility of stewards towards nature. <br><br>(2) Sustainability: Never deteriorate supporting ecosystems. The economy’s throughput should remain within the regenerative capacities of renewable natural resources, within the stocks of non-renewable resources that one has morally allowed oneself to consume, and within the assimilative capacities of nature. <br><br>(3) Circularity: Waste not, want not. The flow of energy and materials within the economy should remain as circular as possible  with the goal of minimising the extraction of virgin resources and the excretion of un- recyclable and unassimilable waste.  <br><br>(4) Socially useful production: What is not needed should not be made. Being only a means to an end, production should satisfy needs and contribute to well-being. <br><br>(5) Small, not-for-profit cooperatives: People and planet, not profit. All businesses should be centred around the pursuit of a social benefit (including ecological missions), be small enough as to allow a directly democratic governance, and take the form of a cooperative. <br><br>(6) Proximity: Produce local, consume local.<br>The shorter the distance between producers and consumers the better. <br><br>(7) Convivial tools: Technology as a tool, not a master. Technology should be fit for a purpose determined outside of itself. Technology should be democratically manageable, controllable, reversible, and easily intelligible. <br><br>(8) Postwork: Work less, play more. The ultimate purpose of economic organisation is to liberate time for non-economic purposes. The time and effort dedicated to activities of provision should be determined autonomously, constitute only a small part of social life, and take place in decent settings, both regarding the condition of work and its finality. <br><br>(9) Value sovereignty: Wealth is nothing but stories. The process of economic valuation should always be informed by social and moral values. What is considered “valuable” can vary in from one context to the next, with different values being fundamental incommensurable with each other. <br><br>(10) Commons: Decide together.1 Strategic resources should be managed as commons. (11) Gratuity: Communities instead of commodities. The provision of goods, services, and amenities determinant for the satisfaction of needs should remain outside of the market domain and be organised politically. <br><br>(12) Sharing: Sufficiency for all, excess for none.2 Any surplus should be treated with caution because it bears the possibility of inequality. When in doubt, liquidate the surplus in a way that benefits the worse off. <br><br>(13) Voluntary simplicity: Outwardly simple, inwardly rich. 3  People should regain autonomy over their needs and wants and reflect on the consequences of their consumption. They should pursue non-materialistic sources of satisfaction and meaning and adapt their relation with possessions accordingly. <br><br>(14) Relational goods: Less stuff, more relationships. People should consume with, and not against, each other. Consumption should focus on the ends (feelings, friendship, love, etc.) and not on the means (products). <br><br>(15) Joie de vivre: If I can’t dance, I don’t want to be part of your economy. There is no wealth but life (Ruskin). Economic organisation should be a means to guaranteeing joie de vivre and life should be lived by enjoying the abundance of nature and culture.<br></p>
