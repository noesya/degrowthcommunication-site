        <p><b>Autonomy &amp; Democracy</b>: <br>Autonomy and democracy are about freeing ourselves from the necessity of working to survive and having the space to make choices that truly enrich our lives. It's about coming together to make decisions democratically, ensuring that our communities live and work in ways that feel right to us. <br><b>Care</b>: <br>Care is about showing compassion and support for each other, our communities, and all life on Earth. It's about valuing kindness and solidarity over competition and greed.<br><b>Justice</b>:<br>Justice means ensuring everyone has a fair chance at a good life, no matter where they come from or what they look like. It's about acknowledging and correcting historical wrongs, reducing excess consumption in wealthier nations and among those living beyond their fair share, aiming for social justice and equality both today and for future generations. It's about making sure that downscaling happens where it's needed most to achieve a balanced and fair distribution of the benefits and impacts of our economy.<br><br><b>Sustainability &amp; Sufficiency</b>: <br>Sustainability and sufficiency ensure everyone has what they need to live well within the ecological limits that allow the planet to support and regenerate all forms of life, now and in the future. It's about making choices that protect the reproduction of life so it continues to thrive with us all.<br><b>Well-being</b>:<br>Well-being is all about living a good, decent and dignified life, where everyone's and everything's health and happiness matter more than how much stuff we own. It's about creating a world where we all feel safe, happy, fulfilled and connected to our communities.<br><b>Sovereignty</b>: <br>Sovereignty is the power of communities to make their own choices about their land, food, water, energy, currency, technology and resources. It's about being in control of what matters to us, ensuring our needs are met without harming the planet. This is particularly emphasised for colonised, oppressed, marginalised and occupied communities) <br><b>Community</b>: Community is about building strong, supportive and resilient networks where we look after each other. It's celebrating togetherness and collaboration, creating a sense of belonging, mutual care and interdependence with each other and our surrounding ecosystems.</p>
