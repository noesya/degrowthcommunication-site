        <p><b>Clearly, media owned by banks and billionaires (who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo) will not help us. <br><br>So we need to improve our strategies. </b><br><br>We often talk about 'degrees of warming,' <b>but 99 % of people don't really know what that means.</b> It's important to explain clearly what it actually leads to.
