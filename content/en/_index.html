        <p><b>"We focus on degrees of warming, which means literally nothing to 99 % of the public. What that actually means needs to be laid out, and it should not just be heat waves or more rain, which also doesn't sound impactful. </b></p><p><b>The war, global financial collapse, famine, disease, hyper-violence and mass death need to be laid out explicitly. This constant emphasis on not overwhelming or frightening people has been one of the biggest mistakes in human history."</b><br></p>
